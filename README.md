# WiFi Wardriving

Android application for WiFi wardriving, with features such as user accounts and an interactive map.

Developed as part of the Mobile applications course at the Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Flutter using the Dart programming language. It is intended to be built for Android only.

### Building

You must either set up an emulator or a real device connection in Flutter and the environment according to the [official documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

To build the project, use:

```sh
flutter build apk
```

To install, run:
```sh
flutter install -d <DEVICE>
```

Alternatively, you can run it with live debugging using the following command:
```sh
flutter run -d <DEVICE>
```

### Layout

* `android` contains Gradle scripts generated by Flutter.
* `assets` contains assets packaged with the application.
* `lib` contains the Dart source code.
  * `achievements.dart` contains code related to the user achievements view.
  * `backend.dart` contains code for interfacing with the Node backend.
  * `discussion.dart` contains code implementing the network details and comments view.
  * `leaderboard.dart` contains the global leaderboard view.
  * `main.dart` contains the main interactive map view and is the entry point for the application.
  * `networks.dart` contains code implementing the network submit view.
  * `user.dart` contains code implementing the login/register page.
* `web` contains files related to the web export. The web export is possible, but not officially supported.
* `pubspec.yaml` contains configuration of the Flutter project and a list of Dart dependencies.
* `analysis_options.yaml` contains options related to Dart static analysis.

## Backend

The backend is built with Node using the TypeScript programming language. It was written primarily to run on Linux, but should work on other operating systems.

### Building

To build the project, pull dependencies first:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run with the `start` script:

```sh
npm run start
```

This will run the project using `npx` on the local interface on port 8000. There is no way to change the port from the commandline.

### Layout

* `src` contains the TypeScript source code.
  * `comments.ts` contains code related to the discussion page feature.
  * `datapoints.ts` contains code related to storage and accessing of network datapoints.
  * `engagement.ts` contains code related to achievements and the leaderboard.
  * `main.ts` contains the server's entry point.
  * `rest.ts` contains primitives related to REST API results and error codes.
  * `users.ts` contains code related to authentication, user login and registration.
* `init.sql` contains SQL code intended to be run in a PostgreSQL server to initialize the database. The script can be ran again to reset the state of the database.
* `package.json` contains the Node package configuration and dependency list.
* `tsconfig.json` contains TypeScript language configuration.
